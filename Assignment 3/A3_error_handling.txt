=======
Error 1:  If the month given is not in the calender. Use try and except to handle the problem.
Srategy:  We can use try and except commands to catch this exception. 
	     If the month entered is not between 1 and 12, then we return an exception saying that the month should be between 1 and 12.
    	try: 
    	    string = calendar.month_abbr[index] 
	    else: 
	        print("Invalid value for month")

Error 2:   If the margin entered is more than width value entered. 
Stategy:   When we take the input, we can check if the margin is more than the width or not. 
	   
	        try:
	            if dict['mrgn'] > dict['width']:
	        except:
	            print("The margin can't be more than the width")

Error 3:   If the margin entered is not a numeric value.
Stategy:  We can resolve this by checking if the margin is numeric or not. 

	     x = formatcmd[1][1]             #takes the margin value.
	     
	     if x.isnumeric() == False:      #checks if value is numeric or not.
	        
	        print("Sorry, the margin should be a numeric value")

	
Error 4: The input file doesn't exist in the directory.
Strategy: We can resolve this error by the following approach: 
	
	     try:                                           
    	    for line in formatinput.input():            # take the value of each line in the input.
	            inputlines.append(line)
	    except:
	        print("The file name does not exist")       # if not, then file entered is not in directory.
